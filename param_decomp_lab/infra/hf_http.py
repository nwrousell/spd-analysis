"""Make huggingface_hub's HTTP backend resilient to transient network flakiness.

HF's default session retries file *downloads* (via `http_backoff`) but mounts a bare
adapter for metadata calls like `HfApi.repo_info` — the call `datasets` makes to resolve
a streaming dataset's layout at startup. A single `ReadTimeout` there raises, and in a
DDP job that one rank's failure tears down every rank before training begins. This mounts
a retrying adapter on the session factory so connect/read timeouts and 408/429/5xx are
retried with jittered backoff across *all* Hub HTTP calls (dataset, tokenizer, model).
